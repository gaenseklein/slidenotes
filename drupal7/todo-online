to make all templates work you have to copy them to your themes-templates-directory
and look out to get them active inside the template.php of your actual theme. 
for mayo i had to put 
if ($node = menu_get_object()){
        $variables['theme_hook_suggestions'][] = 'html__'. $node->type;
}
on begining of function mayo_preprocess_html
