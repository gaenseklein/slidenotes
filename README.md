# slidenotes
This project is still under heavy development and is not meant to be used yet in production! 
Slidenotes aims to take markdown-flavoured notes and transform them into nice presentation at the fly. 
Till now its Core is written in pure Javascript. 
The Core is roughly divided in three parts: 
1. a markdown-parser
2. an editor-part (markdown-wysiwyg-editor and enhanced text-editor)
3. a presentation-maker

In the future its planned to combine this javascript with an CMS like drupal to get a user-experience where you can not only transform md-code into nice presentations, but also store it in a secure form online, share it, publish it and edit it from whatever device you prefer. 
With the design-choice to be a web-app we can achive easily a platform-independence, so you can share, view and edit your slidenotes on your computer - be it with MacIntosh O$X, Window$, Linux, BSD... - or on your mobile device - be it android or iOS.
